Part of the Motor and Sensor Lab for CMU 16-778 Mechatronics Design. This includes interfacing with DHT11 (Temperature & Humidity Sensor), HC-SR04 (Ultrasonic Sensor), FSR (Force Resistive Sensor) - Flex Sensor, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), Rotary Encoder, and Potentiometer and controlling Stepper Motor (42BYG011-25), DC Motor with Encoder, and RC Servo Motor. A Python-based GUI is implemented for real-time monitoring and control.
