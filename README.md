This project aims to design and build a robotic system capable of autonomously traversing a room with
wall outlets and testing their functionality. This project draws inspiration from the real-world challenges
electricians face in newly constructed or renovated buildings, where verifying the functionality of outlets
is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and potentially hazardous.

The value of this approach lies in creating a safer, more efficient, and automated alternative to manual
inspections. By using a robot, the risk of electrical mishaps, such as accidental shocks or short circuits
during testing, is significantly reduced, ensuring a safer operation. Additionally, the system minimizes
human error, speeds up the inspection process, and provides a scalable solution adaptable to other
inspection and maintenance tasks in industries like construction, facility management, and safety testing.
Furthermore, all of the same technology can be used to allow mobile robots to recharge themselves.
